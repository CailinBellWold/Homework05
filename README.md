# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

Refactor a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

### Motivation

### Learning Targets
This exercise furthered experience dynamically updating HTML and CSS using jQuery and introduced the Moment.js library to handle date and time.

## Core Objectives Met

1. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar when the planner is opened.
2. IN PROGRESS: When scrolling down, the user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.
3. IN PROGRESS: Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
4. IN PROGRESS: When a user clicks a timeblock, they can enter an event.
5. IN PROGRESS: When a user clicks a save button for a timeblock, text for that event is saved in local storage.
6. IN PROGRESS: When a user refreshes a page, the saved event persists.
